# LarsNet: Historical Attribution

**Note:** This document preserves attribution to the LarsNet research that originally inspired this project. StemToMIDI now uses the more modern and effective MDX23C model for drum separation, but we maintain this documentation to credit the foundational research that made this work possible.

**LarsNet** was a deep learning model for drum source separation developed by researchers at Politecnico di Milano.

## About LarsNet

LarsNet was a deep drums demixing model that separated five stems from a stereo drum mixture faster than real-time using a parallel arrangement of dedicated U-Nets:

- **Kick Drum**
- **Snare**
- **Tom-Toms** (High, Mid-Low, and Floor tom)
- **Hi-Hat** (Open and Closed Hi-Hat)
- **Cymbals** (Crash and Ride Cymbals)

## StemGMD Dataset

**StemGMD** is a large-scale multi-kit audio dataset of isolated single-instrument drum stems. Each audio clip is synthesized from MIDI recordings of expressive drums performances from Magenta's [Groove MIDI Dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/groove) using ten real-sounding acoustic drum kits.

Totaling **1224 hours of audio**, StemGMD is the largest dataset of drums to date and the first to comprise isolated audio clips for every instrument in a canonical nine-piece drum kit.

**StemGMD is freely available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/7860223) under the CC-BY 4.0 license.**

StemGMD was created by taking all the MIDI recordings in Groove MIDI Dataset, applying a MIDI mapping reducing the number of channels from 22 down to 9, and then manually synthetizing the isolated tracks as 16bit/44.1kHz WAV files with ten different acoustic drum kits using Apple's Drum Kit Designer in Logic Pro X.

StemGMD contains isolated stems of nine canonical drum pieces:
- **Kick Drum**
- **Snare**
- **High Tom**
- **Low-Mid Tom**
- **High Floor Tom**
- **Closed Hi-Hat**
- **Open Hi-Hat**
- **Crash Cymbal**
- **Ride Cymbal**

These stems were obtained by applying the MIDI mapping described in Appendix B of [(Gillick et al., 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06118).

**Note:** StemToMIDI no longer uses these models, having transitioned to the more effective MDX23C architecture.

## Beyond Drums Demixing

The structure of StemGMD follows that of Magenta's Groove MIDI Dataset (GMD). Therefore, GMD metadata is preserved in StemGMD, including annotations such as `drummer`, `session`, `style`, `bpm`, `beat_type`, `time_signature`, `split`, as well as the source MIDI data.

This extends the applications of StemGMD beyond Deep Drums Demixing. StemGMD may rival other large-scale datasets, such as **Expanded Groove MIDI Dataset** ([E-GMD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00188)), for tasks such as Automatic Drum Transcription when considering the countless possibilities for data augmentation that having isolated stems allows for.
