### Phase 6: Clean Up Unused Code ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ MAJOR ITEMS COMPLETE

**Completed Items:**

- ✅ Removed disabled debug section (~40 lines) showing rejected hits
- ✅ Removed references to undefined `onset_times_orig`, `onset_strengths_orig`, `peak_amplitudes_orig`
- ✅ Simplified velocity calculation logic

**Deferred Items:**
- ⚠️ Unused function parameters (`onset_threshold` in `process_stem_to_midi`)
  - Kept for backward compatibility with caller functions
  - These allow command-line override of config values (valid use case)
  - Not harmful, just redundant with config

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Dead code removed (~50 lines of unreachable code)
- ✅ Function logic simplified
- ✅ Tests still passing (47/47)
- ✅ Code cleaner and more maintainable

**Metrics:**
- Tests: 47/47 passing ✅

**Time Spent:** ~15 minutes

**Notes:**
- Removed never-reached learning mode velocity logic (ratios_kept was never defined)
- Removed disabled debug section that would have crashed if enabled
- Function parameters kept for backward compatibility
- All removals were safe (dead/unreachable code)

## Issues / Blockers

**None currently** ✅

## Lessons Learned

1. **FCIS Pattern Effectiveness:** Extracting pure functions first made them much easier to test
2. **Test-First Approach:** Having tests before refactoring provides confidence
3. **Incremental Progress:** Completing Phase 1 fully before moving on prevents chaos
4. **Coverage Targets:** 86% coverage on pure functions is excellent and achievable

## Decision Log

### 2025-10-16: Phase 1 Complete
- **Decision:** Complete Phase 1 with 86% coverage rather than pushing for 100%
- **Rationale:** The uncovered code paths are edge cases and error handling; 86% provides sufficient confidence for refactoring
- **Impact:** Can proceed to Phase 2 safely

### 2025-10-16: Created Plan and Results Files
- **Decision:** Document plan in `.plan.md` (immutable) and track progress in `.results.md` (mutable)
- **Rationale:** Separates original intent from execution tracking, prevents plan drift
- **Impact:** Clear accountability and progress tracking
