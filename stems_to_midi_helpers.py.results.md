  - ✅ envelope_threshold: 0.1
  - ✅ envelope_smooth_kernel: 51
  - ✅ default_note_duration: 0.1
  - ✅ very_short_duration: 0.01
- ✅ Added learning mode constants to config
  - ✅ match_tolerance_sec: 0.05
  - ✅ peak_window_sec: 0.05
- ✅ Updated all Python code to read from config
  - ✅ process_stem_to_midi(): silence check, peak window, sustain params
  - ✅ detect_hihat_state(): sustain window, envelope params
  - ✅ create_midi_file(): note durations
  - ✅ learn_threshold_from_midi(): match tolerance, peak window
- ✅ All 47 tests passing with new config-based approach

**Partially Complete:**
- ⚠️ Cymbal frequency ranges NOT moved to config (deferred - already in helpers)
- ⚠️ Config validation tests NOT added (deferred - existing tests sufficient)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All critical magic numbers moved to config
- ✅ Tests pass with new config structure
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained (defaults provided)
- ⚠️ Config validation tests (deferred to Phase 7)

**Metrics:**
- Tests: 47/47 passing ✅
- Magic numbers moved: 10+ constants
- Config sections added: 2 (audio, learning_mode enhancements)

**Time Spent:** ~1 hour

**Notes:**
- All function signature changes maintain backward compatibility with defaults
- Config values properly cascaded through call stack
- No breaking changes to tests or external API

### Phase 4: Refactor detect_hihat_state() - Use Functional Core ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ ALL ITEMS COMPLETE

**Completed Items:**
- ✅ Removed duplicate sustain calculation code (~30 lines)
- ✅ Replaced with `calculate_sustain_duration()` helper function
- ✅ Simplified to use functional core for sustain analysis
- ✅ Maintained both modes (precalculated vs on-demand)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ ~30 lines removed (inline envelope calculation eliminated)
- ✅ Tests still passing (47/47)
- ✅ Clearer separation of concerns

**Metrics:**
- Tests: 47/47 passing ✅
- Lines removed: ~30 from detect_hihat_state()

**Time Spent:** ~15 minutes

**Notes:**
- Function now uses `calculate_sustain_duration()` instead of inline calculation
- Config parameters properly extracted and passed to helper
- No functional changes, purely refactoring to use functional core
- Both fast path (precalculated) and slow path (on-demand) maintained

## Issues / Blockers

**None currently** ✅

## Lessons Learned

1. **FCIS Pattern Effectiveness:** Extracting pure functions first made them much easier to test
2. **Test-First Approach:** Having tests before refactoring provides confidence
3. **Incremental Progress:** Completing Phase 1 fully before moving on prevents chaos
4. **Coverage Targets:** 86% coverage on pure functions is excellent and achievable

## Decision Log

### 2025-10-16: Phase 1 Complete
- **Decision:** Complete Phase 1 with 86% coverage rather than pushing for 100%
- **Rationale:** The uncovered code paths are edge cases and error handling; 86% provides sufficient confidence for refactoring
- **Impact:** Can proceed to Phase 2 safely

### 2025-10-16: Created Plan and Results Files
- **Decision:** Document plan in `.plan.md` (immutable) and track progress in `.results.md` (mutable)
- **Rationale:** Separates original intent from execution tracking, prevents plan drift
- **Impact:** Clear accountability and progress tracking
