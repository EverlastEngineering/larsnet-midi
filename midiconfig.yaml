# MIDI Conversion Configuration
# Settings for converting drum stems to MIDI notes

# Audio Processing
audio:
  force_mono: true     # Convert stereo files to mono before analysis (recommended)
                       # Uses average of left/right channels

# Onset Detection Parameters (applies to all stems)
onset_detection:
  threshold: 0.01      # Onset strength threshold (0-1). Lower = more sensitive, catches quieter hits
  delta: 0.005         # Peak picking sensitivity. Lower = more sensitive
  wait: 1              # Minimum frames between peaks. 1 = ~11ms, allows fast repeated hits
  hop_length: 512      # Samples between frames. Affects time resolution

# Per-Stem Filtering Settings
# Each stem can have custom spectral filtering to reject artifacts and bleed

kick:
  # Kick drum (bass drum) settings
  midi_note: 36
  
  # Onset detection (overrides global onset_detection settings for kick)
  onset_threshold: null      # Use global setting (0.01) - kicks are loud and easy to detect
  onset_delta: null          # Use global setting (0.005)
  onset_wait: null           # Use global setting (1 frame ~11ms)
  
  # Spectral filtering uses FFT analysis to distinguish real kicks from artifacts
  # Real kick has energy in both fundamental (40-80Hz) and body/attack (80-150Hz)
  # Artifacts (snare bleed, clicks) have low energy in fundamental range
  
  geomean_threshold: 150.0   # Geometric mean of fundamental+body energy
                              # Real kicks: 200-800, Artifacts: 20-150
                              # Set to 150 to be conservative
                              # Increase to 200-250 for stricter filtering
  
  # Spectral ranges for analysis (Hz)
  fundamental_freq_min: 40   # Start of fundamental range (deep bass)
  fundamental_freq_max: 80   # End of fundamental range

snare:
  # Snare drum settings
  midi_note: 38
  
  # Onset detection (overrides global onset_detection settings for snare)

  onset_delta: null          # Use global setting (0.005)
  onset_wait: null           # Use global setting (1 frame ~11ms)
  
  # Spectral filtering uses FFT analysis to distinguish real snare hits from artifacts
  # Real snare has energy in both body (150-400Hz) and wires (2-8kHz)
  # Artifacts (clicks, bleed) have low energy in both ranges
  
  geomean_threshold: 40.0   # Geometric mean of body+wire energy
                              # Real snares: 250-1200, Artifacts: 20-100
                              # Set to 100 to be conservative (catches all real snares)
                              # Increase to 150-200 for stricter filtering
  
  # Spectral ranges for analysis (Hz)

  onset_threshold: 0.05      # Moderate sensitivity (between global 0.01 and cymbals 0.15)
  onset_delta: 0.01          # Moderate peak picking
  onset_wait: 3              # 3 frames = ~35ms min spacing (allows 16th notes at fast tempos)
  
  # Open/Closed detection

cymbals:
  # Crash/ride cymbal settings
  midi_note: 49

  onset_delta: 0.02          # Less sensitive peak picking (global: 0.005)
  onset_wait: 10             # Longer wait between peaks: 10 frames = ~115ms (global: 1 frame = ~11ms)
  
  # Spectral filtering
  geomean_threshold: 10      # Geometric mean of body (1-4kHz) + brilliance (4-10kHz) energy
                              # Real cymbals: 50-500, Artifacts: 5-20
  min_sustain_ms: 150        # Minimum sustain duration in milliseconds
