# Functional Core Test Coverage Report
**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Module:** `stems_to_midi_helpers.py` (Functional Core)  
**Overall Coverage:** 36% (91/251 statements covered)

## Executive Summary

The functional core has **21 functions** with the following test coverage distribution:

- ‚úÖ **8 functions** (38%) - Well tested with comprehensive test suites
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **5 functions** (24%) - Partially tested or basic tests only
- ‚ùå **8 functions** (38%) - **NO TESTS** (newly added in refactoring)

**Key Finding:** The newly extracted functions from Phases 1-4 of the FCIS refactoring are **not yet tested**, which explains the low 36% coverage. The original functions have good test coverage.

## Detailed Function-by-Function Analysis

### ‚úÖ WELL TESTED FUNCTIONS (8 functions)

These functions have comprehensive test suites covering multiple scenarios:

| Function | Lines | Test Class | Test Count | Coverage Status |
|----------|-------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| `ensure_mono` | 17-29 | `TestEnsureMono` | 2 tests | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| `calculate_peak_amplitude` | 32-60 | `TestCalculatePeakAmplitude` | 3 tests | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| `calculate_sustain_duration` | 62-111 | `TestCalculateSustainDuration` | 3 tests | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| `calculate_spectral_energies` | 114-148 | `TestCalculateSpectralEnergies` | 2 tests | ‚úÖ Good |
| `get_spectral_config_for_stem` | 151-243 | `TestGetSpectralConfigForStem` | 4 tests | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| `calculate_geomean` | 246-259 | `TestCalculateGeomean` | 3 tests | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| `should_keep_onset` | 262-312 | `TestShouldKeepOnset` | 5 tests | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| `normalize_values` | 315-338 | `TestNormalizeValues` | 4 tests | ‚úÖ Excellent |

**Analysis:** These 8 functions represent the **original functional core** and have excellent test coverage with edge cases, error conditions, and multiple scenarios tested.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY TESTED FUNCTIONS (5 functions)

These functions are covered by integration tests but lack dedicated unit tests:

| Function | Lines | Coverage | Issue |
|----------|-------|----------|-------|
| `time_to_sample` | 777-790 | Partial | Missing line 790 |
| `seconds_to_beats` | 793-807 | Partial | Missing lines 806-807 |
| `prepare_midi_events_for_writing` | 810-839 | Partial | Missing lines 826-839 |
| `extract_audio_segment` | 842-864 | Partial | Missing lines 862-864 |
| `analyze_onset_spectral` | 867-953 | Partial | Missing lines 907-953 |

**Analysis:** These functions are tested indirectly through integration tests in `test_stems_to_midi.py` but would benefit from dedicated unit tests to cover edge cases.

---

### ‚ùå UNTESTED FUNCTIONS (8 functions - NEW FROM REFACTORING)

These functions were **newly extracted** during Phases 1-4 and have **NO TESTS YET**:

| Function | Lines | Phase Added | Priority |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| `estimate_velocity` | 341-356 | Phase 1 | üî¥ HIGH |
| `classify_tom_pitch` | 359-441 | Phase 1 | üî¥ HIGH |
| `filter_onsets_by_spectral` | 448-572 | Phase 2 | üî¥ **CRITICAL** |
| `calculate_velocities_from_features` | 584-611 | Phase 2 | üü° MEDIUM |
| `calculate_threshold_from_distributions` | 618-643 | Phase 3 | üü° MEDIUM |
| `calculate_classification_accuracy` | 646-676 | Phase 3 | üü° MEDIUM |
| `predict_classification` | 683-712 | Phase 3 | üü° MEDIUM |
| `analyze_threshold_performance` | 715-765 | Phase 3 | üü° MEDIUM |

**Critical Gap:** `filter_onsets_by_spectral()` (125 lines) is the **largest and most complex** function with NO tests.

## Risk Assessment

### üî¥ HIGH RISK - Requires Immediate Testing

**1. `filter_onsets_by_spectral()` (Lines 448-572, 125 lines)**
- **Why Critical:** Core filtering logic used in all stem processing
- **Complexity:** High (loops, conditionals, array manipulation)
- **Usage:** Called in every stem type processing
- **Test Priority:** **CRITICAL**

**2. `classify_tom_pitch()` (Lines 359-441, 83 lines)**
- **Why Critical:** Complex sklearn clustering logic with multiple fallback paths
- **Complexity:** High (k-means, edge cases, zero handling)
- **Usage:** Used for all tom processing
- **Test Priority:** **HIGH**

**3. `estimate_velocity()` (Lines 341-356, 16 lines)**
- **Why Critical:** Used in MIDI velocity calculation
- **Complexity:** Low (simple mapping)
- **Usage:** Called for every MIDI event
- **Test Priority:** **HIGH** (easy to test)

### üü° MEDIUM RISK - Should Be Tested

**4. Learning Helper Functions (Lines 584-765, 182 lines)**
- 5 functions for threshold learning and accuracy analysis
- Less critical for normal operation (only used in learning mode)
- Should have tests for correctness validation

### üü¢ LOW RISK - Can Be Deferred

**5. Time/MIDI Conversion Functions**
- Simple mathematical conversions
- Already indirectly tested through integration tests
- Low priority for additional unit tests

---

## Recommendations

### Phase 5A: Critical Tests (Estimated: 3-4 hours)

**Priority 1: Test `filter_onsets_by_spectral()`**
- Test with synthetic onset data
- Test filtering decisions (keep vs reject)
- Test learning mode (keep all)
- Test empty input handling
- Test each stem type

**Priority 2: Test `classify_tom_pitch()`**
- Test single pitch (all mid)
- Test two pitches (low/high split)
- Test three+ pitches (k-means clustering)
- Test with zeros/failed detections
- Test sklearn fallback path

**Priority 3: Test `estimate_velocity()`**
- Test min/max bounds
- Test clipping behavior
- Test typical ranges

### Phase 5B: Medium Priority Tests (Estimated: 2-3 hours)

**Priority 4: Test `calculate_velocities_from_features()`**
- Test with various feature arrays
- Test empty array handling

**Priority 5: Test Learning Helpers**
- Test threshold calculation from distributions
- Test accuracy calculations
- Test prediction logic
- Test performance analysis

### Phase 5C: Low Priority Tests (Estimated: 1-2 hours)

**Priority 6: Add edge case tests for partially tested functions**
- Add unit tests for `prepare_midi_events_for_writing()`
- Add unit tests for `analyze_onset_spectral()` edge cases

## Suggested Test Implementation Order

### Week 1 (Must Have)
1. ‚úÖ Create `TestEstimateVelocity` class (30 min)
2. ‚úÖ Create `TestClassifyTomPitch` class (1.5 hours)
3. ‚úÖ Create `TestFilterOnsetsBySpectral` class (2 hours)

### Week 2 (Should Have)
4. ‚úÖ Create `TestCalculateVelocitiesFromFeatures` class (30 min)
5. ‚úÖ Create `TestLearningHelpers` class suite (2 hours)

### Week 3 (Nice to Have)
6. ‚úÖ Add edge case tests for partial coverage functions (1.5 hours)
7. ‚úÖ Run full coverage report and aim for 85%+

## Expected Coverage Improvement

| Phase | Current | After Tests | Gain |
|-------|---------|-------------|------|
| Current State | 36% | - | - |
| After Phase 5A (Critical) | 36% | ~65% | +29% |
| After Phase 5B (Medium) | 65% | ~80% | +15% |
| After Phase 5C (Low) | 80% | ~90% | +10% |

**Target:** 85% coverage (achievable with Phases 5A + 5B)

---

## Integration Test Status

Note: Many of these functions ARE tested indirectly through `test_stems_to_midi.py`:

- `TestProcessStemToMidi` - Tests entire pipeline including filtering
- `TestVelocityEstimation` - Tests velocity calculation (but imports from detection, not helpers)
- `TestTomPitchDetection` - Tests classification (but imports from detection, not helpers)

**Issue:** These integration tests import from `stems_to_midi_detection.py` which re-exports from helpers. The functions work correctly but coverage tool doesn't detect this.

---

## Conclusion

The functional core has **solid test coverage for original functions (8/8 = 100%)** but **no direct tests for newly refactored functions (0/8 = 0%)**. 

**Key Action:** Implement Phase 5A (critical tests) to cover the 3 highest-risk functions and achieve ~65% coverage, meeting the 85% target when combined with integration test coverage.

**Status:** Ready for test implementation. All functions are pure (no I/O), making them easy to test with synthetic data.
