# Stems-to-MIDI FCIS Refactoring Results

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Extract Pure Functions from Detection Module
- [x] Move `estimate_velocity()` to helpers.py
- [x] Move `classify_tom_pitch()` to helpers.py
- [x] Update detection.py module docstring
- [x] Update test imports (backwards compatible re-exports added)
- [x] Run tests
- [x] Git commit

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Metrics**: 
- All 47 tests passing
- Functions moved: 2 (estimate_velocity, classify_tom_pitch)
- Lines removed from detection.py: ~95
- Lines added to helpers.py: ~115 (with documentation)
- Test time: 1.54s (improved from 3.04s baseline)

**Issues**: None  
**Decisions**: 
- Added backwards-compatible re-exports in detection.py __all__ to avoid breaking existing imports
- Updated detection.py docstring to clarify role as "Algorithm Coordinators" not "Mix of FC/IS"
- Created new section in helpers.py: "CLASSIFICATION AND MIDI CONVERSION"

---

### Phase 2: Extract Pure Logic from Processor Module
- [x] Create `filter_onsets_by_spectral()` in helpers.py
- [x] Create `calculate_velocities_from_features()` in helpers.py
- [x] Update `process_stem_to_midi()` to use new helpers
- [ ] Create `classify_drum_events()` in helpers.py (DEFERRED - less critical)
- [ ] Write tests for new helpers (DEFERRED to Phase 5)
- [x] Run tests
- [x] Git commit

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (Core Objectives Met)  
**Metrics**: 
- All 47 tests passing
- Lines removed from processor.py: 57 (443 → 386 lines, 13% reduction)
- New helper functions: 2 (filter_onsets_by_spectral, calculate_velocities_from_features)
- Test time: 1.74s
- Filtering logic fully extracted to functional core

**Issues**: None  
**Decisions**: 
- Focused on extracting the most complex filtering loop (90+ lines)
- Deferred `classify_drum_events()` as it's less critical and tom/hihat classification already uses functional core
- Deferred comprehensive testing to Phase 5 to maintain momentum
- Display/logging logic intentionally left in processor (appropriate for imperative shell)

---

### Phase 3: Extract Pure Logic from Learning Module
- [x] Create `calculate_threshold_from_distributions()` in helpers.py
- [x] Create `calculate_classification_accuracy()` in helpers.py
- [x] Create `predict_classification()` in helpers.py
- [x] Create `analyze_threshold_performance()` in helpers.py
- [x] Update `learn_threshold_from_midi()` to use new helpers
- [ ] Create `format_learning_analysis_table()` in helpers.py (DEFERRED - display is shell)
- [ ] Write tests for new helpers (DEFERRED to Phase 5)
- [x] Run tests
- [x] Git commit

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (Core Logic Extracted)  
**Metrics**: 
- All 47 tests passing
- Lines reduced in learning.py: 6 (329 → 323 lines)
- New helper functions: 4 (threshold calculation, accuracy analysis, prediction, performance)
- Test time: 1.56s (improved!)
- All threshold calculation and accuracy analysis now in functional core

**Issues**: None  
**Decisions**: 
- Extracted core calculation logic (threshold, accuracy, classification)
- Display formatting left in learning module (appropriate for shell)
- Functions are pure and highly testable
- Simplified learning module significantly without changing behavior

---

### Phase 4: Reduce process_stem_to_midi() Complexity
- [ ] Extract `_load_and_validate_audio()` helper
- [ ] Extract `_configure_onset_detection()` helper
- [ ] Extract `_detect_and_analyze_onsets()` helper
- [ ] Extract `_filter_and_classify_onsets()` helper
- [ ] Update `process_stem_to_midi()` to orchestrate
- [ ] Run tests
- [ ] Git commit

**Status**: Not Started  
**Metrics**: N/A  
**Issues**: None  
**Decisions**: None

---

### Phase 5: Update Tests and Documentation
- [ ] Add tests for all new helper functions
- [ ] Update existing tests if needed
- [ ] Add docstring documentation
- [ ] Update module docstrings
- [ ] Run full test suite with coverage
- [ ] Git commit

**Status**: Not Started  
**Metrics**: N/A  
**Issues**: None  
**Decisions**: None

## Decision Log

### 2025-10-16: Initial Planning
**Decision**: Create immutable plan file following refactoring instructions  
**Rationale**: Establish clear roadmap and success criteria before starting work  
**Impact**: Provides structure and rollback capability

### 2025-10-16: Phase 1 Complete
**Decision**: Extract pure functions from detection module first  
**Rationale**: Lowest risk, clear wins, establishes pattern for later phases  
**Impact**: detection.py now clearly documented as "Algorithm Coordinators", pure functions in helpers

### 2025-10-16: Phase 2 Scope Adjustment
**Decision**: Focus Phase 2 on extracting filtering loop, defer classify_drum_events()  
**Rationale**: Filtering loop is most complex (90+ lines), highest value extraction  
**Impact**: Achieved 13% file size reduction, all core filtering logic now in functional core

## Notes

### Key Insights
- Functional core/imperative shell pattern well-established in helpers.py and main.py
- Main violations in processor.py (monolithic function), detection.py (mixed roles), learning.py (embedded logic)
- Refactoring should be incremental with tests at each phase
