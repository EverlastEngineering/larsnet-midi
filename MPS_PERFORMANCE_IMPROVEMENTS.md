# MPS Performance Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) optimizations implemented to improve performance, reliability, and maintainability of the PyTorch MPS backend integration.

## Critical Performance Improvements (Phase 1)

### 1. Enabled MPS fp16 Mixed Precision
**File:** `mdx23c_optimized.py`
- **Change:** Extended fp16 support to MPS (was CUDA-only)
- **Impact:** 10-20% potential speedup on Apple Silicon
- **Code:** `self.use_fp16 = use_fp16 and (device == "cuda" or device == "mps")`

### 2. Removed Inefficient MPS STFT Fallback
**File:** `lib_v5/tfc_tdf_v3.py`
- **Change:** Eliminated CPU fallback for STFT/iSTFT operations on MPS
- **Impact:** Removes 4 device transfers per chunk (2 forward + 2 inverse) - **Major performance win**
- **Reason:** PyTorch 2.0+ natively supports STFT on MPS
- **Code:** Changed from `x_is_mps = not x.device.type in ["cuda", "cpu"]` to explicit checking with MPS support

### 3. Added MPS Memory Profiling
**File:** `device_utils.py`
- **Change:** Added system memory tracking for MPS devices
- **Impact:** Better monitoring and debugging capabilities
- **Features:**
  - System memory total and available
  - Memory usage percentage
  - fp16 and STFT support flags based on PyTorch version

### 4. Enabled torch.compile for MPS
**File:** `mdx23c_optimized.py`
- **Change:** Enabled torch.compile optimization for all devices including MPS
- **Impact:** 10-30% potential speedup
- **Previous:** Completely disabled with `if hasattr(torch, 'compile') and False:`
- **Current:** Enabled with proper error handling

### 5. Implemented MPS Warmup Strategy
**File:** `test_mdx_performance.py`
- **Change:** Added explicit warmup runs with documentation
- **Impact:** Pre-compiles MPS kernels, ensures accurate benchmarks
- **Note:** MPS has first-run compilation overhead

### 6. Fixed Device Type Checking
**File:** `lib_v5/tfc_tdf_v3.py`
- **Change:** Explicit device checking instead of negative logic
- **Impact:** Clearer, more maintainable code
- **Before:** `x_is_mps = not x.device.type in ["cuda", "cpu"]`
- **After:** `x_needs_cpu = x.device.type not in ["cuda", "cpu", "mps"]`

## Memory & Cache Management (Phase 2)

### 7. MPS-Specific Batch Size Tuning
**File:** `separation_utils.py`
- **Change:** Added MPS-specific batch size logic
- **Impact:** Optimal memory usage for unified memory architecture
- **Logic:**
  - overlap ≤ 2: batch_size = 4
  - overlap ≤ 4: batch_size = 2
  - overlap > 4: batch_size = 1

### 8. Added MPS Synchronization Points
**File:** `test_mdx_performance.py`
- **Change:** Added `torch.mps.synchronize()` before/after timing
- **Impact:** Accurate benchmarks (GPU operations are async)
- **Locations:** Before timing start, after inference completion

### 9. MPS Cache Management
**File:** `test_mdx_performance.py`
- **Change:** Added `torch.mps.empty_cache()` calls
- **Impact:** Better memory management, consistent benchmark conditions
- **Pattern:** After warmup, after each timed run

### 10. Device Property Caching
**File:** `device_utils.py`
- **Change:** Implemented caching for device properties
- **Impact:** Avoids repeated system queries
- **Implementation:** Module-level `_device_info_cache` dictionary

## Error Handling & Monitoring (Phase 3)

### 11. MPS-Specific Error Context
**File:** `mdx23c_optimized.py`
- **Change:** Added MPS-specific error messages and troubleshooting hints
- **Impact:** Better user experience when issues occur
- **Example:** "Possible causes: out of unified memory, unsupported operation"

### 12. PyTorch Version Checking
**File:** `device_utils.py`
- **Change:** Log PyTorch version, warn if < 2.0
- **Impact:** Helps users understand capability limitations
- **Warning:** "PyTorch 1.x has limited MPS support. Consider upgrading to 2.0+"

### 13. Tensor Contiguity Checks
**File:** `mdx23c_optimized.py`
- **Change:** Added `.contiguous()` calls for MPS tensors before inference
- **Impact:** Prevents MPS kernel failures due to non-contiguous tensors
- **Location:** Before model forward pass in batch processing

### 14. MPS Capability Detection
**File:** `device_utils.py`
- **Change:** Added fp16_support and stft_support flags based on PyTorch version
- **Impact:** Runtime capability awareness
- **Logic:** PyTorch 2.0+ has both features, 1.x doesn't

## Performance Impact Estimates

| Optimization | Estimated Impact | Confidence |
|--------------|------------------|------------|
| Remove STFT CPU fallback | 20-40% speedup | High |
| Enable fp16 on MPS | 10-20% speedup | Medium |
| Enable torch.compile | 10-30% speedup | Medium |
| Optimal batch sizes | 5-15% speedup | High |
| Total Combined | 45-105% speedup | Medium |

**Note:** Actual performance gains depend on model, hardware, and workload. The removal of STFT CPU fallback is the single largest improvement.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Benchmark before/after** on Apple Silicon hardware
2. **Verify fp16 accuracy** matches fp32 output
3. **Test various overlap values** with new batch sizes
4. **Monitor memory usage** with new profiling features
5. **Check torch.compile** doesn't cause issues in specific environments

## Known Limitations

- MPS doesn't expose GPU memory info like CUDA (using system memory as proxy)
- MPS Graph API optimization not implemented (requires significant low-level work)
- No automatic memory pressure detection (would require complex monitoring)
- Pinned memory not applicable (MPS uses unified memory)

## Future Work (Deferred)

These items were identified but not implemented due to complexity or low ROI:

- **Dynamic memory pressure handling:** Monitor and adjust batch sizes at runtime
- **MPS-specific profiling output:** Detailed kernel-level metrics
- **MPS Graph API integration:** Low-level optimization for repeated operations
- **Automatic performance degradation detection:** Log when ops fall back to CPU
