"""
Audio analysis and detection algorithms for stems-to-MIDI conversion.

This module provides functions for detecting drum hits, analyzing pitch,
classifying drum types, and estimating velocity from audio signals.

Architecture: Mix of Functional Core and Imperative Shell
- Onset detection, pitch detection: coordinated algorithms
- Velocity estimation: pure function
- Uses helpers from stems_to_midi_helpers for pure logic
