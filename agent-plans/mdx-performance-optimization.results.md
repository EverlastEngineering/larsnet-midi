- Configurable via `use_fp16` parameter
- Automatically enabled for GPU, disabled for CPU

### 2.3 STFT Optimizations
- [ ] Profile current STFT
- [ ] Test optimizations
- [ ] Implement best approach

### 2.4 Parallel Processing
- [ ] Design parallel architecture
- [ ] Implement and test
- [ ] Benchmark improvements

## Decision Log

### 2025-10-27 - Initial Analysis & Implementation
- Identified main bottleneck: Sequential processing of many overlapping chunks
- Current overlap=8 processes each sample 8 times
- No batch processing utilized

### Key Optimizations Implemented:
1. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple chunks simultaneously in a single forward pass
2. **Buffer Reuse**: Pre-allocate and reuse tensors to reduce memory allocations
3. **Mixed Precision**: Enable fp16 on GPU for faster computation
4. **Inference Optimizations**: Disable gradients, enable cudnn benchmarking, attempt torch.compile
5. **ONNX Export**: Support for exporting to ONNX for potential further speedups

### Integration:
- Updated `separation_utils.py` to automatically use optimized processor when available
- Falls back to original implementation if optimized version not found
- Maintains full backward compatibility

## Test Results

### Test Environment
- Hardware: TBD
- OS: TBD
- PyTorch version: TBD
- CUDA version (if applicable): TBD

### Benchmark Files
1. Test file 1: TBD (30 seconds)
2. Test file 2: TBD (3 minutes)
3. Test file 3: TBD (10 minutes)

## Next Steps
1. Start with batch processing implementation
2. Profile current implementation for baseline
3. Test quality/speed tradeoffs with overlap values
