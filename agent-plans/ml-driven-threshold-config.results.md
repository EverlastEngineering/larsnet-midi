## Current Status: Planning & Prototyping Complete ‚úì

**Date Started**: 2025-10-31  
**Current Phase**: Phase 0 - Discovery & Validation  
**Next Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation Implementation

## Completed Work

### ‚úì Discovery & Validation (2025-10-31)

**Problem Identified**:
- Hi-hat open/closed classification using hardcoded thresholds
- Current logic: `sustain_ms > 90 AND body_energy > 200 AND peak_amplitude < 0.15`
- Issue with project 4: Missing open hi-hats because body_energy=134 < 200

**Tools Developed**:

1. **`debugging_scripts/classifier.py`** ‚úì
   - Random Forest for feature importance ranking
   - Decision Tree for interpretable rules
   - Manual threshold combination testing
   - Results: GeoMean (24.7%) and Total (21.5%) most important features

2. **`debugging_scripts/threshold_optimizer.py`** ‚úì
   - Exhaustive grid search across threshold combinations
   - Tested 372 different rules
   - Found 141 rules with 100% accuracy
   - Ranked by safety margin score
   
3. **`debugging_scripts/data.csv`** ‚úì
   - 160 hi-hat hits from project 4
   - 6 labeled open hi-hats (1.962s, 7.755s, 13.944s, 19.574s, 25.960s, 31.753s)
   - Full spectral features: BodyE, SizzleE, GeoMean, SustainMs, etc.

4. **`debugging_scripts/README.md`** ‚úì
   - Complete documentation of tools and workflow
   - Step-by-step usage guide
   - Scientific explanations of concepts
   - Integration guidance

5. **`agent-plans/ml-driven-threshold-config.plan.md`** ‚úì
   - Comprehensive implementation plan
   - 4-phase rollout strategy
   - YAML schema design
   - User workflow design
   - Future aggregation service concept

**Key Findings**:

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Best Rule | `GeoMean > 300 AND SustainMs > 80 AND BodyE > 50` | 3-feature combination |
| Safety Margin | 49.3% | Excellent safety buffer |
| Accuracy | 100% | Perfect on training data |
| Feature Importance | GeoMean: 24.7%, Total: 21.5%, SizzleE: 18.7% | Spectral energy matters most |

**Validation Results**:
- Single-feature rule (`GeoMean > 535`) only 3.9% margin - RISKY ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Two-feature rule (`GeoMean > 300 AND SustainMs > 80`) 47% margin - SAFE ‚úì
- Three-feature rule (above) 49.3% margin - SAFEST ‚úì‚úì

**Decision**: Use multi-feature AND logic with low thresholds for best safety margins

## Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions

1. **YAML-driven configuration** ‚úì
   - Store rules in midiconfig.yaml per instrument
   - Support multiple rule modes: simple, balanced, robust, custom
   - Backward compatible with existing configs

2. **Multi-feature classification** ‚úì
   - Use AND logic across features (all must pass)
   - Lower individual thresholds = higher combined safety
   - 2-3 features optimal (more = diminishing returns)

3. **Grid search optimization** ‚úì
   - Exhaustive is feasible (< 2000 combinations)
   - Better than gradient descent (interpretable thresholds)
   - Safety margin as primary ranking metric

4. **Local-first approach** ‚úì
   - Tools run locally, no cloud dependency
   - Privacy-preserving (features only, no audio)
   - Optional data sharing for universal model

### User Experience Decisions

1. **Wizard-based workflow** ‚úì
   - Single command to run full optimization
   - Interactive labeling with audio playback
   - Auto-generates config updates

2. **Pre-configured presets** ‚úì
   - Ship with validated simple/balanced/robust rules
   - Users choose complexity level
   - Can override with custom if needed

3. **Progressive enhancement** ‚úì
   - Start with hi-hat (most requested)
   - Extend to snare, cymbals later
   - Learn patterns across instruments

## Metrics & Performance

### Training Data (Project 4)
- **Total samples**: 160 hi-hat hits
- **Positive class**: 6 open hi-hats (3.75%)

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well ‚úì
- **Grid search**: Exhaustive works great for this problem size
- **Margin scoring**: Clear metric for ranking rule safety
- **Multi-feature AND**: Lower thresholds + AND logic = higher margins
- **Visualization**: Feature importance helps understand what matters

### What Could Improve ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **More training data**: 6 examples is minimal, need 20+ for robustness
- **Cross-validation**: Should test on held-out songs
- **Feature engineering**: Could explore more spectral bands
- **Real-time feedback**: Would help during labeling

### Surprising Findings üí°
- SustainMs less important than expected (only 13% vs GeoMean's 25%)
- Lower thresholds paradoxically safer when combined (AND logic)
- Body energy alone inadequate (134 < 200 caused false negative)
- GeoMean captures interaction better than individual energies

## Data Collection Log

|------|---------|------------|---------|---------------|-------|
| 2025-10-31 | 4 | hihat | 160 | 6 | Taylor Swift - Ruin The Friendship |

## Model Versions

| Version | Date | Rules | Accuracy | Margin | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| 0.1-prototype | 2025-10-31 | 3 presets | 100% | 49.3% | Initial ML-optimized rules from project 4 |

## Future Considerations

1. **Deep learning**: If >1000 songs, consider neural network
2. **Real-time optimization**: Auto-suggest rules during playback
3. **Active learning**: System identifies uncertain cases for labeling
4. **Transfer learning**: Pre-train on large dataset, fine-tune per song
5. **Multi-task learning**: Train across instruments simultaneously
