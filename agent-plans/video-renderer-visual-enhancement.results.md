# Video Renderer Visual Enhancement Results

## Phase Completion

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- [x] Add Pillow dependency to environment.yml
- [x] Create PIL/numpy conversion utilities
- [x] Refactor frame creation to use PIL Image objects
- [x] Maintain backward compatibility with FFmpeg pipeline

**Metrics:**
- Tests passing: N/A
- Lines changed: ~200

**Notes:**
- Added Pillow>=10.0.0 to environment.yml
- Created pil_to_cv2() and cv2_to_pil() conversion functions
- FFmpeg pipeline unchanged, still uses numpy arrays

### Phase 2: Enhanced Note Rendering
- [x] Implement rounded rectangle drawing
- [x] Add anti-aliasing to note edges
- [x] Implement fade-in at top
- [x] Implement fade-out at bottom
- [x] Add gradient fill to notes

**Metrics:**
- Tests passing: N/A
- Lines changed: ~200

**Notes:**
- Created draw_rounded_rectangle() helper function with anti-aliasing
- Fade-in over first 150 pixels from top
- Fade-out after strike line over 150 pixels
- Gradient from lighter at top to darker at bottom (30% variation)
- Alpha blending for smooth transparency

### Phase 3: 3D Perspective Effect
- [x] Calculate perspective transformation matrix
- [x] Apply warp to simulate notes coming toward viewer
- [x] Adjust note width/scale based on y-position
- [x] Fine-tune perspective parameters

**Metrics:**
- Tests passing: N/A
- Lines changed: ~50

**Notes:**
- Created apply_perspective_transform() function
- Notes scale up as they approach strike line (15% growth)
- Uses LANCZOS resampling for quality
- X-offset calculated to keep notes centered in lane

### Phase 4: Strike Line Effects
- [x] Implement glow effect when notes cross strike line
- [x] Add radial gradient glow
- [ ] Consider particle burst effect (deferred - may be too busy)
- [x] Enhance circle highlight with smooth alpha

**Metrics:**
- Tests passing: N/A
- Lines changed: ~50

**Notes:**
- Created create_radial_gradient() for glow effects
- Glow intensity peaks when time_until_hit is 0
- Glow radius is 60 pixels, color matches note
- Strike line circles have multi-layer glow effect

### Phase 5: UI Polish
- [x] Enhanced typography with shadows/outlines
- [x] Better color scheme for UI elements
- [x] Smooth gradient background
- [x] Improved legend
- [x] Better progress bar with gradient

**Metrics:**
- Tests passing: N/A
- Lines changed: ~150

**Notes:**
- All text has drop shadow for better readability
- Progress bar has color gradient (green to orange)
- Legend has color-coded circles and improved spacing
- Background has subtle dark blue to black vertical gradient
- Lane lines have vertical gradient for depth
- Strike line has glow effect underneath
