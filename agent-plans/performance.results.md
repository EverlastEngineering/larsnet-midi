## Decision Log

### 2025-10-28 - Starting Performance Improvements
- Following plan order as specified
- Will skip items that risk final delivery and note them
- Focusing on high-impact, low-risk improvements first

### 2025-10-28 - Phase 1 Complete
**Completed:**
- Enabled fp16 for MPS (PyTorch 2.0+ supports it)
- Removed CPU fallback for STFT/iSTFT on MPS (now natively supported)
- Added MPS memory profiling with psutil integration
- Added PyTorch version logging for MPS
- Implemented warmup strategy documentation in benchmarks
- Fixed device type checking to be explicit and clear
- Enabled torch.compile for all devices including MPS

**Key Changes:**
- `mdx23c_optimized.py`: fp16 now works on MPS, torch.compile enabled
- `lib_v5/tfc_tdf_v3.py`: Removed inefficient CPU fallback for MPS STFT ops
- `test_mdx_performance.py`: Added MPS synchronization and cache management
- `device_utils.py`: Added memory profiling and version checking

### 2025-10-28 - Phase 2 Partial Complete
**Completed:**
- Added MPS-specific batch size tuning (4/2/1 based on overlap)
- Added MPS synchronization points in benchmarks
- Added MPS cache management throughout test suite
- Implemented device property caching

**Skipped:**
- Item 9: Memory pressure handling (complex, requires dynamic monitoring)
- Item 10: Device string handling (already consistent)
- Item 12: Buffer reuse optimization (already optimal for MPS unified memory)

### 2025-10-28 - Phase 3-4 Selective Implementation
**Completed:**
- Added MPS-specific error context and troubleshooting hints
- MPS autocast handled via fp16 flag (torch.cuda.amp not needed)
- Added PyTorch version checking with warnings for old versions
- Added tensor contiguity checks for MPS compatibility
- Cached device properties to avoid repeated queries

**Skipped/Not Applicable:**
- Item 15: Performance degradation detection (requires instrumentation)
- Item 16: Hann window optimization (already optimal)
- Item 17: MPS profiling output (significant work, marginal benefit)
- Item 20: Warning suppression (minimal benefit, may hide real issues)
- Item 22: Kernel failure recovery (complex, edge case)
- Item 24: MPS Graph API (requires low-level rewrite, significant effort)
- Item 25: Pinned memory (not applicable to MPS unified memory)

## Impact Summary

**Performance Improvements:**
- MPS fp16 support: potential 10-20% speedup
- Removed STFT CPU fallback: eliminates 4 device transfers per chunk (major)
- torch.compile enabled: potential 10-30% speedup
- MPS-specific batch sizes: optimal memory usage and throughput
- Proper synchronization: accurate benchmarks

**Reliability Improvements:**
- Better error messages for MPS failures
- Version checking with warnings
- Memory profiling and monitoring
- Tensor contiguity checks
- Device property caching

**Code Quality:**
- Explicit device type checking (clearer, more maintainable)
- Consistent MPS handling throughout codebase
- Better separation of device-specific logic
