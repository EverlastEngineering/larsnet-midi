# Mac Native + MPS Support Plan

## Problem Statement

UVR achieves ~269 seconds processing time on Mac using Metal GPU acceleration (overlap=8), while our Docker implementation takes ~777 seconds (2.9x slower). Docker Desktop on macOS **cannot access Metal Performance Shaders (MPS)**, forcing CPU-only execution.

### Key Findings
- **UVR on Mac (overlap=8)**: 269s for 51.7s audio (5.2x real-time) using Metal
- **UVR on Mac (overlap=2)**: ~64s for 51.7s audio (1.24x real-time) using Metal
- **LarsNet Docker on Mac (overlap=8, batch=4)**: 777s for 51.7s audio (15.0x real-time) using CPU only
- **LarsNet Docker on Mac (overlap=2, batch=4)**: 200s for 51.7s audio (3.9x real-time) using CPU only
- **Root cause**: Docker isolation prevents Metal GPU access
- **CPU usage difference**: UVR shows lower CPU usage, confirming GPU acceleration

## Goals

1. **Enable native execution on Mac** with Metal GPU acceleration via PyTorch MPS backend
2. **Maintain Docker on Windows** with NVIDIA GPU support
3. **Achieve UVR-comparable performance** on Mac (3-5x real-time with overlap=8)
4. **Preserve cross-platform compatibility** with graceful fallbacks

## Platform-Specific Requirements

### macOS (Native Execution)
- **GPU**: Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) via PyTorch
- **Setup**: Conda environment outside Docker
- **Target**: ~270 seconds for 51.7s audio (overlap=8), ~60-80s (overlap=2)
- **Device string**: `mps`

### Windows (Docker Execution)
- **GPU**: NVIDIA CUDA via Docker with `--gpus all`
- **Setup**: Docker Desktop + NVIDIA Container Toolkit + WSL2
- **Target**: Similar to Mac with equivalent GPU
- **Device string**: `cuda`

### Fallback (All Platforms)
- **GPU**: None
- **Setup**: Docker or native
- **Device string**: `cpu`

## Technical Details

### PyTorch MPS Backend
```python
# Device detection
if torch.backends.mps.is_available():
    device = torch.device("mps")
elif torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda")
else:
    device = torch.device("cpu")
```

### Known MPS Limitations
- Mixed precision support may differ from CUDA
- Some ops fall back to CPU automatically
- Memory management differs from CUDA
- First inference may be slower (compilation)

### Batch Size Tuning
- **CUDA**: 4-8 chunks typical
- **MPS**: TBD (test 2-8 range)
- **CPU**: 2-4 chunks typical

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
1. Set up native Mac environment
2. Run benchmark with MPS: `python test_mdx_performance.py --device mps`
3. Compare to UVR performance
4. Test all scripts with MPS device
5. Verify quality matches CPU/CUDA output

### Automated Testing
- Add pytest fixtures for device detection
- Mock device availability for CI
- Test device selection logic
- Validate graceful fallbacks

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Requirements
- ✅ MPS device support implemented
- ✅ Native Mac setup documented
- ✅ Performance within 2x of UVR on same hardware
- ✅ All existing functionality works with MPS
- ✅ Graceful fallback when MPS unavailable

### Stretch Goals
- Native Mac setup script (automated)
- Performance profiling tool
- Automatic batch size tuning per device
- WebUI support for native execution

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: MPS Performance Worse Than Expected
- **Mitigation**: Profile and optimize MPS-specific bottlenecks

- **Investigation**: Compare with UVR's Metal implementation

### Risk: Breaking Changes for Docker Users
- **Mitigation**: Maintain backward compatibility
- **Testing**: Comprehensive Docker testing on all platforms
- **Documentation**: Clear migration guide if needed

### Risk: Complex Setup Barrier
- **Mitigation**: Detailed step-by-step instructions
- **Automation**: Setup scripts where possible
- **Support**: Troubleshooting guides for common issues

## Implementation Order

1. **Commit current work** (optimization code)
2. **Add MPS device detection and support**
3. **Test MPS performance on Mac**
4. **Document native Mac setup**
5. **Add Docker GPU support for Windows**
6. **Cross-platform testing and benchmarking**
