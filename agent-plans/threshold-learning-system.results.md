# Threshold Learning System - Results

## Status: Phase 1 In Progress ⚙️

## Completed
- [x] Architecture design
- [x] File structure defined
- [x] Command interface specified
- [x] Stem config schema designed
- [x] Identified feature extraction point: `filter_onsets_by_spectral()` → `all_onset_data`
- [x] Created module structure: stems_to_midi/optimization/
- [x] Implemented extract_features.py (MVP)
- [x] Created hihat.yaml config

## Metrics
- Files created: 4
- Lines of code: ~200
- Time: ~30 minutes

## Key Implementation Details
1. **Feature extraction** - Uses `filter_onsets_by_spectral()` with `learning_mode=True` to keep ALL onsets
2. **CSV format** - Matches debugging_scripts/data.csv format exactly
3. **Current guess** - Status column shows KEPT/REJECTED by current logic
4. **No audio playback** - User will use DAW to find timestamps (answered question)
5. **Storage location** - user_files/{project}/optimization/ (answered question)

## Pending Questions (Answered!)
- [x] Where in detection.py to capture pre-filter features? → `all_onset_data` from `filter_onsets_by_spectral()`
- [x] Audio playback library preference? → User will use DAW
- [x] Store optimization files? → user_files/{project}/optimization/

## Next Steps (Phase 1 Continuation)
1. Test extract_features.py on project 4 hihat
2. Implement label.py (interactive labeler)
3. Implement core.py (Bayesian optimizer - port from debugging_scripts)
4. Implement apply_thresholds.py (update midiconfig.yaml)
