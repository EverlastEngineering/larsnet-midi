## Decision Log

### [Date: 2025-10-19] Initial Plan Created
- Selected Flask for backend (lightweight, Python-native)
- Selected vanilla JS + Tailwind for frontend (minimal dependencies)
- Chose SSE over WebSockets (simpler for one-way status updates)
- Decided to defer YAML editor to Phase 4+ (focus on core functionality first)

### [Date: 2025-10-19] Plan Revised Based on Feedback
- Changed Phase 4 from YAML text editor to graphical config interface
- Moved all YAML parameters into Phase 3 as form controls (advanced collapsible panels)
- Distributed documentation throughout all phases (not deferred to end)
- Added error handling and user feedback from Phase 1 onward
- Renamed Phase 5 to "Testing & Polish" focusing on quality and documentation
- Updated general instructions to emphasize documentation as first-class concern

## Notes

### Phase 1 Complete ✓
Backend API is fully implemented with:
- ✓ Complete REST API for all operations
- ✓ Async job queue with threading
- ✓ Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- ✓ Comprehensive error handling with helpful messages
- ✓ Full documentation (WEBUI_API.md + WEBUI_SETUP.md)
- ✓ Unit test suite with 80%+ coverage target
- ✓ Docker configuration updated (port 5000, Flask dependencies)
- ✓ README updated with web UI quick start

**Architecture Principles Followed:**
- Functional core: project_manager functions remain pure, API orchestrates
- Imperative shell: All side effects in API handlers and job workers
- Documentation first: Every file, function, and endpoint documented
- Error handling first: Comprehensive error responses throughout
- Zero modifications to existing core modules

### API Endpoints Implemented
Projects:
- GET /api/projects - List all projects
- GET /api/projects/:id - Get project details  
- GET /api/projects/:id/config/:name - Get config file

Upload:
- POST /api/upload - Upload audio and create project

Operations (async via job queue):
- POST /api/separate - Stem separation
- POST /api/cleanup - Sidechain compression
- POST /api/stems-to-midi - MIDI conversion
- POST /api/render-video - Video rendering

Jobs:
- GET /api/jobs - List all jobs
- GET /api/jobs/:id - Get job status
- GET /api/jobs/:id/stream - SSE real-time updates
- POST /api/jobs/:id/cancel - Cancel job
- GET /api/projects/:id/jobs - Get project jobs

Health:
- GET /health - API health check

### Phase 2 Complete ✓
Frontend UI fully implemented with:
- ✓ Responsive single-page application
- ✓ Project sidebar with status indicators
- ✓ Drag-and-drop file upload
- ✓ Operation buttons with state management
- ✓ Real-time progress tracking via SSE
- ✓ Live console with color-coded logs
- ✓ Toast notifications for user feedback
- ✓ Loading overlays and animations
- ✓ Mobile-responsive design
- ✓ Comprehensive inline documentation

**Key Features:**
- Projects auto-load on startup
- Upload progress with percentage
- Jobs monitored with SSE for real-time updates
- Operation buttons enable/disable based on project state
- Color-coded status indicators throughout
- Smooth transitions and animations

### Phase 3 Progress
YAML Configuration Engine complete:
- ✓ Built config_engine.py with ConfigField, ConfigSection, ValidationRule, YAMLConfigEngine classes
- ✓ Implemented round-trip YAML editing with comment preservation (ruamel.yaml)
- ✓ Type inference: bool, int, float, string, path
- ✓ Validation: range checking, MIDI note validation, extensible ValidationRule
- ✓ Comment extraction for UI labels/descriptions
- ✓ API endpoints: GET/POST /api/config/:project/:type, validate, reset
- ✓ Comprehensive test suites (test_config_engine.py, test_config_api.py)
- ✓ Added ruamel.yaml to environment.yml

**Architecture:**
- Functional core: ConfigField/Section/Engine are pure data transformations
- Imperative shell: API endpoints handle HTTP and file I/O
- Validation built-in: Range hints extracted from comments like "(0-1)"
- Round-trip safe: Preserves formatting, comments, key order

**Critical Design Decisions:**
- Used ruamel.yaml instead of PyYAML for comment preservation
- Type inference based on Python types + heuristics (paths detected)
- Validation rules created automatically from comment patterns
- max_depth parameter controls nesting level for UI rendering
- to_ui_control() provides frontend-ready field specifications

### Next Steps
1. Test configuration engine with actual project files
2. Build frontend UI components for config panels
3. Implement basic parameter panels (separate, cleanup, midi, video)
4. Implement advanced collapsible sections per YAML file
5. Add localStorage persistence for user preferences

### Testing Phase 1
To test the backend:
1. Rebuild Docker: `docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build`
2. Enter container: `docker exec -it larsnet-midi bash`
3. Run tests: `pytest webui/test_api.py -v`
4. Start server: `python -m webui.app`
5. Test API: `curl http://localhost:49152/health`

All tests should pass once Flask dependencies are installed via Docker rebuild.
