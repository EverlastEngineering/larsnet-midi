Address each of these in order. If you run into an issue with one where it may impact delivering the final result, note this and skip it.

Metal/MPS Integration Improvement Opportunities
1. MPS-Specific Optimizations - fp16 NOT POSSIBLE
Current state: Mixed precision (fp16) is explicitly disabled for MPS (use_fp16 = use_fp16 and device == "cuda")
Issue: While PyTorch 2.0+ can perform fp16 inference on MPS, audio I/O libraries (soundfile, torchaudio) don't support float16 arrays, causing ValueError when saving
Status: CANNOT BE FIXED - fp16 must remain CUDA-only due to ecosystem limitations
Location: mdx23c_optimized.py, line 69
2. Inefficient MPS Fallback Pattern
Current state: STFT operations fallback to CPU for MPS with manual device transfers (x_is_mps = not x.device.type in ["cuda", "cpu"])
Improvement: PyTorch's STFT now supports MPS natively in recent versions. The fallback mechanism causes unnecessary CPUâ†”GPU transfers
Location: tfc_tdf_v3.py, lines 15-28 and 34-51
Impact: Every STFT/iSTFT operation incurs 4 device transfers (2 forward, 2 inverse)
3. No MPS Memory Profiling
Current state: Memory information only retrieved for CUDA (torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_memory)
Improvement: Add MPS memory tracking capabilities (though MPS doesn't expose as much info as CUDA)
Location: device_utils.py, lines 77-93
4. Missing MPS-Specific Cudnn Equivalent
Current state: Only enables cudnn benchmark for CUDA: if self.device.type == "cuda": torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True
Improvement: Check if there are MPS-specific backend optimizations that could be enabled
Location: mdx23c_optimized.py, lines 100-101
5. No MPS Warmup Strategy
Current state: Metal Performance Shaders have known first-run compilation overhead
Improvement: Implement explicit warmup runs for MPS to pre-compile kernels before timing
Location: test_mdx_performance.py and production code
6. Suboptimal Device Type Checking
Current state: Uses negative logic not x.device.type in ["cuda", "cpu"] to detect MPS
Improvement: Use explicit x.device.type == "mps" for clarity and maintainability
Location: tfc_tdf_v3.py, lines 15, 34
7. torch.compile Disabled Globally
Current state: if hasattr(torch, 'compile') and False: - completely disabled
Improvement: torch.compile works on MPS and could provide 10-30% speedup. Should enable with try/except for MPS
Location: mdx23c_optimized.py, lines 106-111
8. No Batch Size Tuning for MPS
Current state: Batch size defaults to 4 for all devices (or auto-calculated for CPU/CUDA)
Improvement: MPS has different memory characteristics - could benefit from MPS-specific batch size optimization
Location: separation_utils.py, lines 420-427
Note: Documentation mentions batch_size=1 for overlap=8 on MPS (results.md), but no automatic tuning
9. Missing MPS Memory Pressure Handling
Current state: No MPS-specific memory pressure detection or adaptive behavior
Improvement: MPS can run out of unified memory - could detect and adjust batch sizes dynamically
Location: Error handling throughout
10. Inconsistent MPS Device String Handling
Current state: Some places use string 'mps', others use torch.device('mps')
Improvement: Standardize on torch.device objects for type safety
Location: Multiple files (device_utils.py, mdx23c_optimized.py, etc.)
11. No MPS Synchronization Points
Current state: No explicit synchronization for MPS operations
Improvement: Add torch.mps.synchronize() at critical timing points to ensure accurate benchmarks
Location: test_mdx_performance.py, timing sections
12. Buffer Reuse Not Optimized for MPS
Current state: Pre-allocated buffers use same strategy for all devices
Improvement: MPS unified memory might benefit from different buffer management strategy
Location: mdx23c_optimized.py, _init_buffers() method, lines 116-130
13. No MPS Cache Management
Current state: Only clears CUDA cache: if device == "cuda": torch.cuda.empty_cache()
Improvement: MPS has torch.mps.empty_cache() available - should use for memory management
Location: test_mdx_performance.py, lines 60, 78, and anywhere else cache is cleared
14. Missing MPS Error Context
Current state: Generic error messages don't differentiate MPS-specific issues
Improvement: Add MPS-specific error messages and troubleshooting hints
Location: Error handling throughout
15. No Detection of MPS Performance Degradation
Current state: No monitoring for MPS-specific performance issues (like CPU fallbacks)
Improvement: Add logging/warnings when MPS operations fall back to CPU
Location: Throughout processing pipeline
16. Hardcoded Hann Window Device Transfer
Current state: self.hann_window = torch.hann_window(self.win_length, periodic=True).to(device) in unet.py
Improvement: For MPS, this is fine, but could be lazy-loaded when needed
Location: unet.py, line 34
17. No MPS-Specific Profiling Output
Current state: Performance metrics don't show MPS-specific details
Improvement: Add MPS compile time, kernel count, unified memory usage to profiling
Location: Profiling/benchmarking code
18. Autocast Only for CUDA
Current state: with torch.cuda.amp.autocast(): only wraps CUDA execution
Improvement: Consider MPS autocast equivalent if available
Location: mdx23c_optimized.py, line 154
19. No MPS Backend Version Check
Current state: Checks if MPS is available but not which version/capabilities
Improvement: Different PyTorch/macOS versions have different MPS capabilities - should check and adapt
Location: device_utils.py, device detection logic
20. Documentation Mentions UserWarning But Doesn't Handle It
Current state: Results file notes "UserWarning observed but functional" for MPS fallbacks
Improvement: Suppress expected MPS warnings or provide context about why they're safe to ignore
Location: STFT operations, could add warning filters
21. Missing MPS Tensor Contiguity Checks
Current state: No explicit checks for tensor contiguity which MPS sometimes requires
Improvement: Add .contiguous() calls where needed for MPS compatibility
Location: Tensor operations throughout
22. No MPS Kernel Launch Failure Recovery
Current state: If MPS kernel fails, no automatic retry or fallback
Improvement: Add retry logic with CPU fallback for robustness
Location: Model inference code
23. Inefficient Device Property Caching
Current state: get_device_info() recomputes info every call
Improvement: Cache device properties since they don't change during runtime
Location: device_utils.py, get_device_info() function
24. MPS Graph Optimization Not Leveraged
Current state: No use of MPS Graph API for optimizing repeated operations
Improvement: For repeated inference, could use MPSGraph for better performance
Location: Model execution pipeline
25. No Pinned Memory for MPS Transfers
Current state: Regular memory allocations for CPU<->MPS transfers
Improvement: Use pinned memory for faster transfers where applicable
Location: Data loading and transfer code
