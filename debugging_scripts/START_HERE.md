# 👋 Welcome to Threshold Optimization Tools!

## You're in the Right Place If...

- ✅ You want to optimize hi-hat open/closed detection
- ✅ You have audio with hi-hat hits
- ✅ You want ML-driven threshold configuration
- ✅ You're curious about optimization algorithms

## 🚀 Super Quick Start

**Copy/paste this into your terminal:**

```bash
cd debugging_scripts
python compare_optimizers.py
```

That's it! This runs all three optimization methods and tells you the best thresholds.
