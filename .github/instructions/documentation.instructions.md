Only make summary documents when asked to do so.
Always update existing architecture and documentation files in place.
Keep the documentation factual, concise and free of speculation. Avoid editorializing or making assumptions about intent.
When updating documentation, the final result should read like the it has always been this way. It should not appear like a change log, but rather a single source of truth.
When writing documentation, use present tense and active voice.
