# Stems to MIDI Conversion Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to convert your cleaned drum stems into MIDI tracks that can be imported into any DAW. The `stems_to_midi.py` script analyzes each drum stem, detects hits (onsets), estimates velocities, and creates MIDI files with proper General MIDI drum mapping.

## Why Convert to MIDI?

✅ **Retriggering**: Use your favorite drum samples  
✅ **Quantization**: Fix timing issues  
✅ **Editing**: Easy to adjust individual hits  
✅ **Mixing**: Replace or blend with original audio  
✅ **MIDI Learn**: Use for triggering lights, visuals, or other MIDI devices  
✅ **Drum Programming**: Study and learn from real performances

---

## Prerequisites

The script requires the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install librosa midiutil numpy soundfile scipy
```

**To check if you have them installed in your Docker environment, please run:**

```bash
pip list | grep -E "(librosa|midiutil|scipy|soundfile)"
```

And let me know what you get!

---

## Quick Start

### Basic Conversion

Convert your cleaned stems to MIDI with default settings:

```bash
python stems_to_midi.py -i cleaned_stems/ -o midi_output/
```

This will:
- Analyze all stems in `cleaned_stems/` directory
- Detect drum hits automatically
- Create MIDI files in `midi_output/` directory
- Use General MIDI drum note mapping

---

## Usage

### Basic Command

```bash
python stems_to_midi.py -i <input_dir> -o <output_dir> [OPTIONS]
```

### Common Options

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `-i` / `--input_dir` | *required* | Directory with separated stems (kick/, snare/, etc.) |
| `-o` / `--output_dir` | `midi_output` | Where to save MIDI files |
| `-t` / `--threshold` | `0.3` | Onset detection sensitivity (0-1) |
| `--min-vel` | `40` | Minimum MIDI velocity (1-127) |
| `--max-vel` | `127` | Maximum MIDI velocity (1-127) |
| `--tempo` | `120.0` | Tempo in BPM |
| `--no-hihat-detection` | *disabled* | Disable open/closed hi-hat detection |
| `--stems` | *all* | Specific stems to process |

---

## MIDI Note Mapping

The script uses **General MIDI (GM) drum mapping** standard:

| Drum Type | MIDI Note | Note Name | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Kick** | 36 | C1 | Bass Drum 1 |
| **Snare** | 38 | D1 | Acoustic Snare |
| **Toms** | 45 | A1 | Low Tom |
| **Hi-Hat (Closed)** | 42 | F#1 | Closed Hi-Hat |
| **Hi-Hat (Open)** | 46 | A#1 | Open Hi-Hat |
| **Cymbals** | 49 | C#2 | Crash Cymbal 1 |

### Additional Available Notes

The script also defines these alternatives (can be customized in code):

- **Kick Alt**: 35 (Bass Drum 2)
- **Snare Alt**: 40 (Electric Snare)
- **Tom Low**: 45, **Tom Mid**: 47, **Tom High**: 50
- **Ride Cymbal**: 51
- **China Cymbal**: 52

## Examples

### 1. Basic Conversion (Recommended Starting Point)

```bash
python stems_to_midi.py -i cleaned_stems/ -o midi_output/
```

**Use this for:** Most drum tracks with standard dynamics

### 2. More Sensitive Detection (Capture Quiet Hits)

```bash
python stems_to_midi.py -i cleaned_stems/ -o midi_output/ -t 0.2
```

**Use when:**
- Missing ghost notes on snare
- Quiet hi-hat hits not detected
- Soft kick hits being missed

⚠️ **Warning:** May create false positives (extra notes from noise)

### 3. Less Sensitive Detection (Only Strong Hits)

```bash
python stems_to_midi.py -i cleaned_stems/ -o midi_output/ -t 0.5
```

**Use when:**
- Getting too many false positives
- Want only the main hits
- Removing artifacts or bleed-induced triggers

✅ **Benefit:** Cleaner MIDI with fewer errors

### 4. Full Velocity Range (Maximum Dynamics)

```bash
python stems_to_midi.py -i cleaned_stems/ -o midi_output/ --min-vel 1 --max-vel 127
```

**Use when:**
- Want maximum dynamic range
- Working with expressive samples
- Need full MIDI velocity spectrum

### 5. Narrow Velocity Range (Consistent Levels)

```bash
python stems_to_midi.py -i cleaned_stems/ -o midi_output/ --min-vel 80 --max-vel 100
```

**Use when:**
- Want consistent velocities
- Samples are velocity-sensitive and you want control
- Matching a specific sample library's "sweet spot"

### 6. Specific Tempo

```bash
python stems_to_midi.py -i cleaned_stems/ -o midi_output/ --tempo 140
```

**Use when:** You know the exact BPM of your track

### 7. Process Only Specific Stems

```bash
python stems_to_midi.py -i cleaned_stems/ -o midi_output/ --stems kick snare
```

**Use when:**
- Only need certain drums
- Want to process stems separately with different settings

### 8. Disable Hi-Hat Open/Closed Detection

```bash
python stems_to_midi.py -i cleaned_stems/ -o midi_output/ --no-hihat-detection
```

**Use when:**
- Hi-hat detection is inconsistent
- All hi-hats should be one type
- Processing electronic/programmed hi-hats

---

## Complete Workflow

### Full Pipeline: Separation → Cleanup → MIDI

```bash
# Step 1: Separate drums with Wiener filter
python separate.py -i input/ -o separated_stems/ -w 1.5

# Step 2: Clean up kick/snare bleed with sidechain
python sidechain_cleanup.py -i separated_stems/ -o cleaned_stems/

# Step 3: Convert to MIDI
python stems_to_midi.py -i cleaned_stems/ -o midi_output/
```

### Testing Different Detection Settings

When you're unsure of the best settings, try multiple configurations:

```bash
# Conservative (fewer notes)
python stems_to_midi.py -i cleaned_stems/ -o midi_conservative/ -t 0.5

# Balanced (default)
python stems_to_midi.py -i cleaned_stems/ -o midi_balanced/ -t 0.3

# Sensitive (more notes)
python stems_to_midi.py -i cleaned_stems/ -o midi_sensitive/ -t 0.2
```

Then compare the results and pick the best one!

## Understanding Onset Detection

### What is Onset Detection?

**Onset detection** identifies the exact moment when a drum hit occurs by analyzing:
- Energy changes in the audio signal
- Spectral flux (changes in frequency content)
- Transient characteristics

### Threshold Parameter (`-t`)

The threshold controls sensitivity:

- **Lower threshold (0.1-0.2)**: 
  - More sensitive
  - Detects quiet hits and ghost notes
  - ⚠️ May detect noise as hits
  
- **Medium threshold (0.3-0.4)**: 
  - Balanced detection
  - Good for most tracks
  - ✅ Recommended starting point
  
- **Higher threshold (0.5-0.7)**:
  - Less sensitive
  - Only strong, clear hits
  - Fewer false positives

### Velocity Estimation

The script analyzes the **strength** of each detected onset and converts it to MIDI velocity:

1. Measures the energy of the transient
2. Normalizes across all hits in that stem
3. Maps to your specified velocity range (min-vel to max-vel)
4. Result: Dynamic MIDI that reflects the original performance

---

## Advanced Features

### Hi-Hat Open/Closed Detection

The script attempts to distinguish between open and closed hi-hat by analyzing the decay:

- **Closed hi-hat**: Short, tight decay → MIDI note 42
- **Open hi-hat**: Longer sustain → MIDI note 46

**How it works:**
- Analyzes 50ms window after each hit
- Measures decay envelope
- Classifies based on sustain duration

**Limitations:**
- May not be 100% accurate
- Works best on well-separated stems
- Can be disabled with `--no-hihat-detection`

### Per-Stem Processing

Process each stem with different settings for optimal results:

```bash
# Kick: Less sensitive (avoid false triggers)
python stems_to_midi.py -i cleaned_stems/ -o midi_kick/ --stems kick -t 0.4

# Snare: Balanced
python stems_to_midi.py -i cleaned_stems/ -o midi_snare/ --stems snare -t 0.3

# Hi-hat: More sensitive (catch ghost notes)
python stems_to_midi.py -i cleaned_stems/ -o midi_hihat/ --stems hihat -t 0.2
```

Then manually combine the MIDI files in your DAW.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Missing drum hits in MIDI

**Symptoms:** 
- Obvious hits in audio are not in MIDI
- Ghost notes or quiet hits missing

**Solutions:**
1. Lower the threshold: `-t 0.2` or `-t 0.15`
2. Check that the stem file actually contains those hits
3. Verify audio quality (heavy compression can reduce transients)

### Problem: Too many false MIDI notes

**Symptoms:**
- Extra notes that aren't real hits
- Noise being detected as hits
- Multiple triggers for single hits

**Solutions:**
1. Raise the threshold: `-t 0.4` or `-t 0.5`
2. Clean up audio first (use sidechain cleanup)
3. Apply gentle gating to stems before conversion
4. Check for bleed from other instruments

### Problem: MIDI velocities all sound the same

**Symptoms:**
- No dynamic variation in MIDI
- All hits seem to be same velocity level

**Solutions:**
1. Increase velocity range: `--min-vel 20 --max-vel 127`
2. Check source audio dynamics (heavily compressed audio = less velocity variation)
3. Verify that your MIDI player/sampler is velocity-sensitive
4. Try processing longer sections to get better velocity normalization

### Problem: Hi-hat open/closed detection is wrong

**Symptoms:**
- Closed hats marked as open or vice versa
- Inconsistent hi-hat articulation

**Solutions:**
1. Disable detection: `--no-hihat-detection`
2. Manually edit MIDI in your DAW
3. Adjust the detection algorithm threshold (requires code modification)
4. Process open and closed hi-hats as separate tracks

### Problem: Wrong tempo in DAW

**Symptoms:**
- MIDI events don't line up with audio
- Timing is off when imported

**Solutions:**
1. Specify correct tempo: `--tempo 140` (or whatever your track is)
2. MIDI tempo doesn't affect timing of events (they're in absolute seconds)
3. DAW tempo should match the MIDI file tempo
4. Check that your DAW is importing at the correct sample rate

### Problem: MIDI notes on wrong drum sounds

**Symptoms:**
- Kick plays as snare or vice versa
- Drums trigger wrong sounds in virtual instrument

**Solutions:**
1. Check your drum sampler's MIDI mapping
2. Verify it's using General MIDI standard
3. Manually remap notes in your DAW
4. Some drum libraries use different mappings - check documentation

## Working with MIDI in Your DAW

### Importing MIDI Files

1. **Drag and drop** MIDI file into DAW
2. **Assign drum instrument** on that track
3. **Verify note mapping** matches your instrument
4. **Adjust** as needed

### Common DAW Tips

**Ableton Live:**
- Use Drum Rack with General MIDI mapping
- Map MIDI notes to sample slots

**Logic Pro:**
- Use Drum Kit Designer or Drum Machine Designer
- Both support GM mapping by default

**Pro Tools:**
- Load Strike or other drum plugin
- Check MIDI note mapping in plugin

**FL Studio:**
- Use FPC or any drum sampler
- Map notes in Channel Settings

### Editing MIDI

Common edits you might want to make:

- **Quantize**: Snap notes to grid for tighter timing
- **Velocity adjustments**: Humanize or level out dynamics
- **Delete false positives**: Remove unwanted trigger notes
- **Add missed hits**: Draw in any notes the detection missed
- **Split to tracks**: Separate each drum to its own MIDI track
- **Groove templates**: Apply swing or other timing variations

### Blending with Audio

Use MIDI alongside the original audio:

1. **Layering**: Keep both audio and triggered samples
2. **Replacement**: Mute audio, use only MIDI-triggered samples
3. **Reinforcement**: Blend samples with audio (e.g., add sub to kick)
4. **Parallel processing**: Different effects on audio vs. samples

## Tips & Best Practices

### 🎯 Detection Tips

1. **Start with defaults** and adjust only if needed
2. **Use cleaned stems** (after sidechain cleanup) for best results
3. **Test multiple thresholds** and compare
4. **Process shorter sections** first to dial in settings
5. **Visual inspection**: Import MIDI with audio to verify alignment

### 🎚️ Velocity Tips

1. Default range (`40-127`) works for most use cases
2. Wider range (`1-127`) for maximum dynamics
3. Narrower range (`80-100`) for consistent levels
4. Check your sample library's velocity curves

## Advanced Customization

### Modifying MIDI Note Mappings

Edit the `DrumMapping` class in `stems_to_midi.py`:

```python
@dataclass
class DrumMapping:
    kick: int = 36      # Change to your preferred MIDI note
    snare: int = 38
    # ... etc
```

### Custom Onset Detection Parameters

For fine control, modify the `detect_onsets()` function parameters:

```python
onset_frames = librosa.onset.onset_detect(
    pre_max=3,      # Frames before peak for comparison
    post_max=3,     # Frames after peak
    delta=0.07,     # Peak picking threshold
    wait=10         # Minimum frames between peaks
)
```

### Velocity Curve Adjustment

Modify `estimate_velocity()` function to change how dynamics are mapped:

```python
def estimate_velocity(strength: float, min_vel: int = 40, max_vel: int = 127) -> int:
    # Apply curve: strength**2 for exponential, sqrt(strength) for compressed
    curved_strength = strength ** 1.5  # More aggressive dynamics
    velocity = int(min_vel + curved_strength * (max_vel - min_vel))
    return np.clip(velocity, 1, 127)
```

## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Load Audio**: Reads WAV file for each stem
2. **Onset Detection**: Uses librosa's onset detection algorithm
   - Computes spectral flux
   - Identifies transient peaks
   - Applies peak picking
3. **Velocity Estimation**: Measures onset strength and normalizes
4. **Hi-Hat Classification**: Analyzes decay envelope (if enabled)
5. **MIDI Generation**: Creates MIDI file with proper timing and velocities

### Onset Detection Algorithm

Uses librosa's onset detection which implements:
- **Spectral flux**: Change in frequency content
- **Peak picking**: Local maxima detection
- **Backtracking**: Refines onset times to transient start
- **Aggregation**: Combines multiple onset strength functions

### Accuracy

**Expected accuracy:**
- ✅ **90-95%** for clean, well-separated stems
- ⚠️ **70-85%** for stems with bleed or complex rhythms
- 📝 Manual editing may be needed for perfect results

### Limitations

- Cannot detect drum hits that weren't separated by LarsNet
- Velocity estimation is approximate (based on transient energy)
- Hi-hat open/closed detection is not 100% reliable
- Very fast rolls may not all be detected
- Works best with percussive, transient-rich drums

## Comparison with Other Tools

| Tool | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| **This Script** | Free, automatic, batch processing, velocity-sensitive | Requires good separation |
| **Superior Drummer 3** | Very accurate | Expensive, manual |
| **Drumatom** | Purpose-built | Paid, bleed-focused |
| **Manual MIDI** | 100% accurate | Time-consuming |

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know the tempo beforehand?**  
A: No! MIDI events are stored as absolute times in seconds. The tempo parameter is just metadata.

**Q: Can I use this on live drum recordings?**  
A: Yes, but you must separate the drums first using LarsNet. Works best on isolated drum tracks.

**Q: Will this work with electronic/programmed drums?**  
A: Absolutely! In fact, it may work even better since they have cleaner transients.

**Q: Can I retrigger other instruments (not drums)?**  
A: The onset detection works on any percussive audio, but MIDI note mapping is drums-specific. You'd need to modify the code.

**Q: How do I handle drum rolls?**  
A: Lower the threshold (`-t 0.15`) to catch fast notes. May need manual cleanup for super-fast rolls (32nd notes, etc.).

**Q: What if my DAW shows wrong timing?**  
A: Verify the sample rate matches (44.1kHz) and that your DAW's tempo is set correctly.

**Q: Can I merge multiple MIDI files?**  
A: Yes, in any DAW or using MIDI editing software. Or process multiple tracks separately and combine.

**Q: How do I fix wrong velocities?**  
A: Adjust the `--min-vel` and `--max-vel` range, or edit velocities in your DAW afterward.
